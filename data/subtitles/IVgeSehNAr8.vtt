00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:17.760
I just got it for sure Back in the studio I don't wanna go

2
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:27.760
Don't like this feeling like fuck being alone These demons weighing on me soon as I step out of these doors but the show must go

3
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:37.759
What is life it don't matter no My life flashing by and time is moving too slow These worries keep me from the truth that I know

4
00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:51.759
Now I'm dying and dead inside And I can't die alone And I've been blinded for way too long

5
00:00:51.759 --> 00:01:00.759
All the shows gone On and on and on I'm holding on and on

6
00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:12.069
Time waits for no one Got money on the go and I'm selling out the shows and I'm putting off a bro Still I'm feeling all alone

7
00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:19.069
Cause I be at the parties Turning myself in by Cardi All these girls be acting muddy But I'm on my way back home

8
00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:26.069
You see my life ain't beautiful if you're to look inside it I got problems that need fixing but it's easier just to hide it

9
00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:34.069
Yes we're all trying to stay alive Running out the clock till it's our time

10
00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:39.069
Yeah the show must go on Cause the sun gon' come up and tomorrow's for no one

11
00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:46.069
If you don't get up and grab it Never take it for granted Nothing's ever gonna happen Fear is self fabricated

12
00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:57.069
I won't be a victim of my past Imperfections of my dies Yeah mama cry again Sister hating on my fam I've been through a lot but I'm good now

13
00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:12.069
Singing on the stage with a bitch My show must go on On and on and on I'm holding on and on Time waits for no one

14
00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:28.069
The show must go on
